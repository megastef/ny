# ny (fork of n with iojs support)

Simple flavour of iojs binary management, no subshells, no profile setup, no convoluted api, just _simple_.

## Installation

    $ npm install -g ny

or

    $ make install

to `$HOME`. Prefix later calls to `ny` with `NY_PREFIX=$HOME`

    $ NY_PREFIX=$HOME make install

### Installing Binaries

Install a few nodes:

    $ ny 1.0.4
    $ ny 1.0.2
    $ ny 1.0.1

Type `ny` to prompt selection of an installed iojs. Use the up /
down arrow to navigate, and press enter or the right arrow to
select, or ^C to cancel:

    $ ny

      1.0.1
    Î¿ 1.0.3
      1.0.4

Use or install the latest official release:

    $ ny latest

Use or install the stable official release:

    $ ny stable

Switch to the previous version you were using:

    $ ny prev

### Removing Binaries

Remove some versions:

    $ ny rm 1.0.4 v1.0.1

Instead of using `rm` we can simply use `-`:

    $ ny - 1.0.4

### Binary Usage

When running multiple versions of iojs, we can target
them directly by asking `ny` for the binary path:

    $ ny bin 1.0.4
    /usr/local/n/versions/1.0.4/bin/node

Or by using a specific version through `ny`'s `use` sub-command:

    $ ny use 1.0.4 some.js

with flags:

    $ ny as 1.0.4 --debug some.js

## Usage

## Details

 `ny` by default installs node to _/usr/local/ny/versions_, from
 which it can see what you have currently installed, and activate previously installed versions of node when `ny <version>` is invoked again.

 Activated nodes are then installed to the prefix _/usr/local_, which of course may be altered via the __NY_PREFIX__ environment variable.

 To alter where `ny` operates simply export __NY_PREFIX__ to whatever you prefer.
